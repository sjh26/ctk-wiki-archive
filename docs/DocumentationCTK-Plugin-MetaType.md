The OSGi Metatype specification provides a unified way to describe metadata about services and how to retrieve and manipulate such information. This information can optionally be localized, thus allowing the developer to provide human-readable metadata descriptions in multiple languages. The specification defines a rich dynamic typing system to describe service attributes in a precise way, which makes it possible to dynamically create user interfaces to configure services.
