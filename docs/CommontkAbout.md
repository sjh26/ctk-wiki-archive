The goals of CTK are as follows:
- Provide a unified set of basic programming constructs that are useful for medical imaging applications development
- Facilitate the exchange and combination of code and data
- Document, integrate, and adapt successful solutions
- Avoid the duplication of code and data
- Continuously extend to new tasks within the scope of the toolkit (medical imaging) without burdening existing tasks
